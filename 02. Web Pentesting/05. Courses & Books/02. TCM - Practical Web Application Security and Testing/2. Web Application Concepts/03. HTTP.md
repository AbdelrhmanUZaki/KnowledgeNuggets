## üì• HTTP Responses

- Every response has a **status code**:

    - `500s`: Server error.

## üß™ curl Tips

- Basic request:  
    `curl https://facebook.com`
    
- Verbose output (`-v`) shows:
    
    - HTTPS/TLS negotiation
        
    - Request/response headers
        
    - Line break between headers and body
        
- Redirection:
    
    - HTTP ‚Üí HTTPS shows `301 Moved Permanently` with `Location` header.
        
    - Use `-L` to follow redirects:  
        `curl -L http://facebook.com`
        
- Change request method:  
    `curl -X POST https://example.com`  
    ‚Üí If `405`, method is not allowed on that URL.
    
- Add headers manually:  
    `curl -H "User-Agent: ChatGPT" https://example.com`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note

- **User-Agent spoofing** is a common technique in attacks.
    
- Never rely only on headers for security logic.
