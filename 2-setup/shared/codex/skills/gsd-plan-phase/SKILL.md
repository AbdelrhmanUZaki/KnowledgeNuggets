## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked by mentioning `$gsd-plan-phase`.
- Treat all user text after `$gsd-plan-phase` as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. AskUserQuestion → request_user_input Mapping
GSD workflows use `AskUserQuestion` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex `request_user_input`:

Parameter mapping:
- `header` → `header`
- `question` → `question`
- Options formatted as `"Label" — description` → `{label: "Label", description: "description"}`
- Generate `id` from header: lowercase, replace spaces with underscores

Batched calls:
- `AskUserQuestion([q1, q2])` → single `request_user_input` with multiple entries in `questions[]`

Multi-select workaround:
- Codex has no `multiSelect`. Use sequential single-selects, or present a numbered freeform list asking the user to enter comma-separated numbers.

Execute mode fallback:
- When `request_user_input` is rejected or unavailable, you MUST stop and present the questions as a plain-text numbered list, then wait for the user's reply. Do NOT pick a default and continue (#3018).
- You may only proceed without a user answer when one of these is true:
  (a) the invocation included an explicit non-interactive flag (`--auto` or `--all`),
  (b) the user has explicitly approved a specific default for this question, or
  (c) the workflow's documented contract says defaults are safe (e.g. autonomous lifecycle paths).
- Do NOT write workflow artifacts (CONTEXT.md, DISCUSSION-LOG.md, PLAN.md, checkpoint files) until the user has answered the plain-text questions or one of (a)-(c) above applies. Surfacing the questions and waiting is the correct response — silently defaulting and writing artifacts is the #3018 failure mode.

## C. Task() → spawn_agent Mapping
GSD workflows use `Task(...)` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex collaboration tools:

Direct mapping:
- `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` → `spawn_agent(agent_type="X", message="Y")`
- `Task(model="...")` → omit. `spawn_agent` has no inline `model` parameter;
  GSD embeds the resolved per-agent model directly into each agent's `.toml`
  at install time so `model_overrides` from `.planning/config.json` and
  `~/.gsd/defaults.json` are honored automatically by Codex's agent router.
- Resolved `reasoning_effort="low|medium|high|xhigh"` (`xhigh` is a GSD/Codex tier, not a generic runtime enum) → pass `reasoning_effort`
  to `spawn_agent` when the runtime/tool supports it. Omit missing, empty,
  inherited, or unsupported values; do not invent one-off effort literals in
  workflow prose.
- `fork_context: false` by default — GSD agents load their own context via `<files_to_read>` blocks
- `Task(isolation="worktree")` / `Agent(isolation="worktree")` → no direct Codex mapping.
  Codex `spawn_agent` does not create or bind a git worktree automatically.
  Workflows that require this isolation must fail closed or use an explicit
  manual worktree protocol before spawning (#3360).

Spawn restriction:
- Codex restricts `spawn_agent` to cases where the user has explicitly
  requested sub-agents. When automatic spawning is not permitted, do the
  work inline in the current agent rather than attempting to force a spawn.

Parallel fan-out:
- Spawn multiple agents → collect agent IDs → `wait(ids)` for all to complete

Result parsing:
- Look for structured markers in agent output: `CHECKPOINT`, `PLAN COMPLETE`, `SUMMARY`, etc.
- `close_agent(id)` after collecting results from each agent

<objective>
Create executable phase prompts (PLAN.md files) for a roadmap phase with integrated research and verification.

**Default flow:** Research (if needed) → Plan → Verify → Done

**Research-only mode (`--research-phase <N>`):** Spawn `gsd-phase-researcher` for phase `N`, write `RESEARCH.md`, then exit before the planner runs. Useful for cross-phase research, doc review before committing to a planning approach, and correction-without-replanning loops where iterating on research alone is dramatically cheaper than re-spawning the planner. Replaces the deleted `$gsd-research-phase` command (#3042).

**Research-only modifiers:**
- **No flag** — when `RESEARCH.md` already exists, prompt the user to choose `update / view / skip`.
- **`--research`** — force-refresh: re-spawn the researcher unconditionally, no prompt. Skips the existing-RESEARCH.md menu.
- **`--view`** — view-only: print existing `RESEARCH.md` to stdout. Does not spawn the researcher. Cheapest mode for the correction-without-replanning loop. If no `RESEARCH.md` exists yet, errors with a hint to drop `--view`.

**Orchestrator role:** Parse arguments, validate phase, research domain (unless skipped), spawn gsd-planner, verify with gsd-plan-checker, iterate until pass or max iterations, present results.

<runtime_note>
**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `AskUserQuestion`. They are equivalent — `vscode_askquestions` is the VS Code Copilot implementation of the same interactive question API. Do not skip questioning steps because `AskUserQuestion` appears unavailable; use `vscode_askquestions` instead.

<context>
Phase number: {{GSD_ARGS}} (optional — auto-detects next unplanned phase if omitted)

**Flags:**
- `--research` — Force re-research even if RESEARCH.md exists
- `--skip-research` — Skip research, go straight to planning
- `--gaps` — Gap closure mode (reads VERIFICATION.md, skips research)
- `--skip-verify` — Skip verification loop
- `--prd <file>` — Use a PRD/acceptance criteria file instead of discuss-phase. Parses requirements into CONTEXT.md automatically. Skips discuss-phase entirely.
- `--ingest <path-or-glob>` — Use one or more ADR files instead of discuss-phase. Parses locked decisions + scope fences into CONTEXT.md automatically. Skips discuss-phase entirely.
- `--ingest-format <auto|nygard|madr|narrative>` — Optional ADR parser format override (`auto` default).
- `--reviews` — Replan incorporating cross-AI review feedback from REVIEWS.md (produced by `$gsd-review`)
- `--text` — Use plain-text numbered lists instead of TUI menus (required for `/rc` remote sessions)
- `--mvp` — Vertical MVP mode. Planner organizes tasks as feature slices (UI→API→DB) instead of horizontal layers. On Phase 1 of a new project, also emits `SKELETON.md` (Walking Skeleton). Can be persisted on a phase via `**Mode:** mvp` in ROADMAP.md.

Normalize phase input in step 2 before any directory lookups.
