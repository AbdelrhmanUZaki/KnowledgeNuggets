You should watch the lesson since it’s hands-on, but here’s a summary of the key points below.

## Brave Profile Setup

- Create a new Brave profile named `Pentest` to isolate pentesting activities.
    
- This keeps extensions, cookies, and history separate from your main profile.
    

## Extensions to Install

- **Wappalyzer**: For identifying web technologies (CMS, JS libs, servers).
    
- **SwitchyOmega**: For easy switching between proxy and direct connection.
    

## SwitchyOmega Configuration

- Create a Proxy profile named `ZAP` with:
    
    - Protocol: HTTP
        
    - Server: 127.0.0.1
        
    - Port: 8080
        
- Switch to this profile when intercepting traffic with ZAP.
    

## ZAP Certificate Setup (New UI)

- Go to `Options > Network > Server Certificate` in ZAP.
    
- Download the certificate (`owasp_zap_root_ca.cer`).
    
- In Brave:
    
    - Visit `brave://settings/security`
        
    - Go to **Manage Certificates > Authorities**
        
    - Import the `.cer` file and trust it for identifying websites.
        

## ZAP UI Overview

- **Sites Tree**: Displays visited domains and grouped requests.
    
- **Request/Response View**: Shows headers and content of HTTP messages.
    
- **History Tab**: Logs all requests with method, status code, response size, and alerts.
        
- **Status Bar**: Displays proxy info and alert summaries.
