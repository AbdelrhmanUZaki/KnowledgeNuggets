When you open `https://google.com` in your browser after connecting your laptop to the company’s network via an Ethernet cable, the process can be mapped to the OSI model as follows:

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1):**
    - **Action:** You connect your laptop to the network using an Ethernet cable. At this layer, the data is transmitted as raw binary signals (electrical pulses or light signals) over the cable.
    - **Protocols/Examples:** Ethernet, DSL, USB

2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2):**
	- **Action:** Your laptop encapsulates data into frames and sends them over the Ethernet network. It uses MAC (Media Access Control) addresses to manage and direct data frames to the correct physical device.
    - **Protocols/Examples:** PPP

3. **Network Layer (Layer 3):**
    - **Action:** At this layer, your laptop needs an IP address to communicate with devices both within the local network and outside of it. This IP address is typically obtained from a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.
    - **DHCP Process:**
        - **Discovery:** Your laptop sends a DHCP Discover message to locate DHCP servers.
        - **Offer:** DHCP servers respond with a DHCP Offer message containing an IP address and other configuration information.
        - **Request:** Your laptop responds with a DHCP Request message, indicating it wants the offered IP address.
        - **Acknowledgement:** The DHCP server sends a DHCP Acknowledgement message confirming the IP address and other details.
    - **Action:** Once your laptop has an IP address, it can now route packets to other networks, including the internet.
    - **Protocols/Examples:** IP, ICMP, OSPF, DHCP

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4):**
    - **Action:** The TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) layer establishes a connection with Google's server to ensure reliable data transmission. This involves a three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) to set up a session.
    - **Protocols/Examples:** TCP, UDP, SCTP

5. **Session Layer (Layer 5):**
    - **Action:** This layer manages the communication session between your browser and Google’s server. It ensures that the session is maintained throughout the interaction, handling the opening and closing of sessions.
    - **Protocols/Examples:** NetBIOS, RPC, PPTP

6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6):**
	- **Action:** The browser initiates a secure HTTPS connection, which involves the SSL/TLS handshake process. This includes:
	    - **Client Request:** The client browser requests a secure HTTPS page from the web server.
	    - **Certificate Exchange:** The web server responds with an SSL certificate and its public key.
	    - **Certificate Validation:** The client browser checks the validity of the certificate and creates a symmetric session key using the public key, which is then sent to the web server.
	    - **Key Decryption:** The web server decrypts the symmetric session key using its private key.
	    - **Secure Communication:** Both the client browser and web server use the symmetric session key to encrypt and decrypt data for secure communication.
	- **Protocols/Examples:** SSL/TLS, JPEG, GIF

7. **Application Layer (Layer 7):**
    - **Action:** You enter `https://google.com` into the browser. The browser constructs an HTTP GET request to fetch the webpage. The application layer protocols handle high-level interactions such as web requests and responses.
    - **Protocols/Examples:** HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP

### Summary of the Process:

- **Physical & Data Link Layers:** Handle the physical connection and local data transmission, including obtaining MAC addresses and managing data frames.
- **Network Layer:** Involves obtaining an IP address from DHCP and routing packets to the destination network, both within and outside the local network.
- **Transport Layer:** Establishes and manages a reliable connection for data transfer.
- **Session Layer:** Manages the communication session between your browser and Google’s server.
- **Presentation Layer:** Encrypts data and translates it into a suitable format using SSL/TLS for secure transmission.
- **Application Layer:** Handles the high-level request to access and display the webpage.
