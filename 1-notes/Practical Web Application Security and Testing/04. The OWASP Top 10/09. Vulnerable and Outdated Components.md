# Vulnerable and Outdated Components

### Concept

- Classic **supply chain attack** risk.
    
- Caused by outdated or vulnerable **libraries**, **plugins**, or **dependencies**.
    
- Can affect both **server-side** (e.g., Apache, Log4j) and **client-side** (e.g., JS libraries).
    
- Often exploited alongside other vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, RCE).

### Examples

- **Apache** vulnerabilities
    
- Flaws in **JavaScript imported libraries**
    
- **Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)**

### ðŸ”¥ Log4Shell in Brief

- Critical **RCE** in **Log4j 2** via malicious `${jndi:ldap://...}` payload.
    
- Exploits **JNDI injection** to fetch and execute remote code.
    
- Affected thousands of systemsâ€”**deeply embedded**, **easy to exploit**.
    
- Still relevant due to **slow patching** and **widespread use**.
