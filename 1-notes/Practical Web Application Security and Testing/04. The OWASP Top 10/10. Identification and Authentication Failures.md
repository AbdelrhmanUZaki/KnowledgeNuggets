# Identification and Authentication Failures

- This is more about **design flaws** than specific exploits.
    
- Key concerns:
    
    - Can credentials be **brute-forced**?
        
    - Is **username enumeration** possible? (e.g., WordPress showing different errors for valid vs invalid users)
        
    - Is **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** in place and enforced?
        
- Focus is on **how the system validates identity**, and whether the process can be bypassed or guessed.

## Weak Sessions

What is a weak session?  
A session is **weak** if its ID is predictable, guessable, or reversible—allowing attackers to hijack sessions easily.

### DVWA Examples:

- **Low level**: Session IDs are numeric (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`) → **trivially guessable**.
    
- **Medium level**: Longer IDs like `123412322` that are **timestamp-based** (predictable if you know the time).
    
- **High level**: Session ID is just a sequential number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) hashed with MD5 — easy to reverse using tools like `hash-identifier` or CrackStation.
    

> Even if hashed, weak original data makes the session insecure.
