# SQL Injection 

## Concept

- SQLi = Injecting malicious input into database queries.
- Any user input that touches DB (login, search, filters...) can be vulnerable.
    
Example (PHP):

```php
"SELECT * FROM USERS where username='" . $_POST['username'] . "' AND password='" . $_POST['password'] . "'";
```

## DVWA Low Security (Why `'1 OR 1=1; --` Works)

- No input sanitization.
    
- Payload `'1 OR 1=1; --` always makes condition true ➔ bypass login.
    
	**Important Note:**  
	When manually entering payloads like `1 OR 1=1; -- `, **always add a space before and after the `--`**.  
	**Why?**  
	Without the space, SQL might not treat it as a comment, leading to syntax errors or failed injections.
## DVWA Medium Security

- ID taken from dropdown (integer expected, not string, so no need for the `'` before the `1` ).
    
- Direct input → error.
    
- Need proxy (ZAP/Burp) to manually modify request.
    
- Integer-based injection works (`1 OR 1=1; --`).

## Fuzzing with ZAP (When direct input fails)

- Use **FuzzDB**:  
    `Fuzz > Payloads > SQL-Injection > Detection`
    
- You might tight down to `MySQL.txt` (because backend = MySQL), Or just select the `Detectino` to let it try all payloads.
    

**Recon** (like identifying DB) helps choosing the right payloads.

## ZAP Active Scan (Faster Detection)

We will disable all weapons that comes with ZAP and only apply the SQLI to avoid unnecessary attacks.

- Right-click request → **Active Scan**.
    
- **Advanced options**:
    
    - Policy → Apply: **Off**
        
    - Threshold: **All**
        
    - Select only **SQL Injection** category → Threshold: **Medium**.
        
- Start scan.
    

✅ Successful payloads: `1+or+1%3D1%3B+--+` , `1 or 1=1; -- `

## SQLMap (Automated SQLi Exploitation)

- Save vulnerable request → `.raw` file.
    
- Command:

```bash
sqlmap -r sqli-dvwa.raw --dbms mysql
```

- Automates detection and exploitation (with options for error, boolean, time, union).

## Blind SQL Injection (DVWA Practical)

- App only responds with "User exists" / "User does not exist."
    
- No direct SQL errors ➔ **Blind SQLi**.
    

Finding the number of columns:

- `1' ORDER BY 1; -- ` ✅
    
- `1' ORDER BY 2; -- ` ✅
    
- `1' ORDER BY 3; -- ` ❌
    

Conclusion: 2 columns exist.

>Why?
In SQL, ORDER BY n sorts results based on the nth column.
When an invalid column index (like 3 when only 2 columns exist) is requested, the database returns an error.
Therefore, the last successful ORDER BY shows the real number of columns.

Manual exploitation is great for learning, but in real-world pentests, we move to **SQLMap** after confirming vulnerability.

## Types of SQL Injection

- **Union-based**: Extract data visibly with UNION queries.
    
- **Error-based**: Force database errors to leak data.
    
- **Boolean-based Blind**: Rely on True/False behavior changes.
    
- **Time-based Blind**: Detect vulnerabilities using server response delays.
    

---

## Final Notes

- ZAP is good for basic fuzzing and detection.
    
- SQLMap is the **preferred tool** for full exploitation and automation.
    
- Always perform recon to adjust payloads (DB type, input behavior).
    
- Pay attention to payload syntax (spaces before/after `--`) to avoid simple injection failures.
