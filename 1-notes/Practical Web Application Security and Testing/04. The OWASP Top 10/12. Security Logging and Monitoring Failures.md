# Security Logging and Monitoring

- **Focus**: Check if attacks are logged, detected, or ignored.
    
- Often evaluated **after** a pentest during the **debrief**.
    
- Key questions:
    
    - Were **SQLi, XSS, brute force** attempts logged?
        
    - Are logs centralized and secure?
        
    - Is there a **WAF** or monitoring tool, and did it react?
        
- **Pro Tip**: During testing, track which actions should raise alerts (e.g., heavy SQLMap use, repeated XSS payloads) â€” check later if they were caught.
    
- Reminder: The **debrief/report** is just as critical as the test itself.
