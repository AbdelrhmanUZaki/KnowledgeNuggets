# Security Misconfiguration

### What is it?

- Misconfigured systems or components that unintentionally expose the application to attackers.
    

### Common Issues

- Default credentials still enabled.
    
- Missing hardening (e.g., unused services running, verbose error messages).
    
- Unnecessary features left exposed (e.g., debug tools, file upload handlers).
    

> Pentester Insight: You often find more than expected. A simple backend network tool might expose command injection functionality.

## Example: XXE (XML External Entities)

- XML inputs can define external entities.
    
- If not disabled, attackers can:
    
    - Access local files on the server (e.g., `/etc/passwd`)
        
    - In some configurations, escalate to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
