# SSRF â€“ Server-Side Request Forgery

- **What it is**:  
    An attacker tricks the server into making a request **on their behalf**, often to internal systems the attacker can't access directly.
    
- **Impact**:
    
    - Access internal services (e.g., `localhost`, `169.254.169.254` for cloud metadata).
        
    - Port scanning internal networks.
        
    - Sometimes leads to **RCE**, file reading, or **privilege escalation** (especially in cloud setups).
        
- **Common vulnerable spots**:
    
    - Image/video URL uploaders.
        
    - Webhooks, PDF converters, URL previews, etc.
