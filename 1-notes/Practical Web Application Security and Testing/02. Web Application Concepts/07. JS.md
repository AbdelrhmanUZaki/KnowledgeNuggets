## What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript (JS)** is a programming language used to add **interactivity and logic** to websites. While **HTML** provides structure and **CSS** controls style, **JavaScript controls behavior**—how the page responds to user actions.

JavaScript runs in the browser and interacts with the **DOM (Document Object Model)** to dynamically update content and respond to events.

---

## What Can JavaScript Do?

- Respond to user actions (clicks, typing, scrolling)
- Modify or create HTML elements dynamically
- Communicate with servers via APIs (AJAX, Fetch)
- Validate forms and process input
- Build complete frontend applications

## Adding JavaScript to Your Page

### 1. Inline (not preferred)

```html
<button onclick="alert('Clicked!')">Click</button>
```

### 2. Internal Script

```html
<script>
  console.log("Hello from JS");
</script>
```

### 3. External File (recommended)

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

## JavaScript Basics

### Variables

```javascript
let name = "Sara";
const age = 25;
var legacy = "Avoid using var";
```

### Data Types

- String: `"Hello"`
- Number: `42`
- Boolean: `true` or `false`
- Array: `["JS", "HTML"]`
- Object: `{ name: "Ali", role: "Dev" }`

---

### Functions

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Welcome, " + name);
}
greet("Zaki");
```

---

### Events

```html
<button onclick="changeColor()">Click Me</button>

<script>
  function changeColor() {
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = "lightblue";
  }
</script>
```

---

### DOM Manipulation

```html
<p id="demo">Original</p>
<button onclick="updateText()">Update</button>

<script>
  function updateText() {
    document.getElementById("demo").textContent = "Updated!";
  }
</script>
```

## Template Literals and `$` Inside Strings

Instead of using `+` for concatenation, JavaScript supports **template literals** using backticks `` ` ``. This allows for cleaner and more readable string formatting using `${}` to insert variables.

### Example:

```javascript
let name = "Nour";
let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Nour!
```

You can even write multiline strings:

```javascript
let info = `This is line 1
This is line 2
Name: ${name}`;
```

## Developer Tools: Console Tab

- Use **Inspect → Console** to:
    - Run JavaScript live
    - View errors and warnings
    - Use `console.log()` for debugging

---

## Event Listeners Tab in DevTools

### What It Does

The **Event Listeners** tab in DevTools shows you:

- Which elements have event listeners
- The types of events (`click`, `submit`, `keyup`, etc.)
- The function that runs when the event is triggered
- File name and line number of the source

### How to Use It

1. Right-click an element → Inspect
2. In the **Elements** tab, find the **"Event Listeners"** section on the sidebar
3. Expand any event type (like `click`) to:
    - See the attached function
    - Click the file name to go to the source

### Remove a Listener Temporarily

Sometimes during debugging, you might want to **disable an event listener** that is interfering with your work.

- In the **Event Listeners** tab, you can:
    - Click the small "remove" (🗑) icon (in some browsers) next to the function
    - This temporarily disables the listener **without changing the code**
    - Very helpful when testing behavior without specific event triggers

This is especially useful when debugging pages with lots of scripts or 3rd-party libraries.
