## Note

This is a hands-on lesson — it’s recommended to follow along with the video. Below is a summary of the key steps and commands.

---

## SSH & Lab Setup

1. SSH into your Ubuntu server, then clone the course repo:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mttaggart/pwst-resources
    cd pwst-resources/2-10_zap-lab
    ```
    
2. Run the lab web app with Nginx:
    
    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```
    

### What’s Inside `run.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
docker container run --name pwst-2-10 --rm -d -v $(pwd)/site:/usr/share/nginx/html -p 80:80 nginx:latest
```

Explanation:

- `--name pwst-2-10`: Names the container
    
- `--rm`: Removes it when stopped
    
- `-d`: Runs in background
    
- `-v`: Mounts the local `site/` folder to the container's web root
    
- `-p 80:80`: Exposes the site at `http://localhost`
    
- `nginx:latest`: Uses the official Nginx image

## Accessing the Lab Website

- Access the app at `http://ubuntu-server`  
    (Make sure `ubuntu-server` is mapped to the correct ubuntu server's IP in your `/etc/hosts` file.)

## Using ZAP with Brave

1. Launch Brave configured to use ZAP as a proxy.
    
2. Visit `http://ubuntu-server` — the site will appear in ZAP's Sites section.
    

---

## Scanning with ZAP

1. Include the site in a context:
    
    - Right-click on `http://ubuntu-server` > `Include in Context` > `New Context` > OK
        
2. In the Contexts section:
    
    - Right-click the new context > choose `Spider` > Start Attack
        
3. You may see some 404 paths in the Sites tree — feel free to delete them.

## Investigating for Clues

- Always view the page source:
    
    - Use the browser or ZAP's response viewer
        
    - Check for comments, hidden links, or credentials

## Fuzzing with ZAP

- Use SecLists as your wordlist collection:  
    [https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)
    

How to Fuzz:

1. In ZAP, open a request like `GET /index.html`
    
2. Highlight part of the request (e.g., `index`)
    
3. Right-click > Fuzz
    
4. In the right panel, go to Payloads > click Add
    
5. Choose the type:
    
    - Use File Fuzzer (from ZAP add-ons), or
        
    - Choose File and upload your own (e.g., from SecLists)
        
6. Click Start Fuzzer
    

ZAP's fuzzer is fast and useful for discovery testing.
