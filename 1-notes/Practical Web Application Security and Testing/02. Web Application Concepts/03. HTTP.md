## 📌 HTTP Summary

- **HTTP** defines how web traffic is structured; active since 1990.
    
- Based on **RFC 2608, 2616**.
    
- **HTTPS** is the encrypted version of HTTP.
    

---

## 📤 HTTP Requests

- Target a URL using **methods/verbs** like: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, etc.
    
- All requests have **headers** (e.g., for authentication).
    
- Some have a **body** (e.g., form data or JSON in POST).
    

---

## 📥 HTTP Responses

- Every response has a **status code**:
    
    - `200s`: Success
    - `300s`: Redirect
    - `400s`: Client error
    - `500s`: Server error.
        
- Can include a **body** (e.g., HTML, JSON).
    
- Headers and body are **separated by a line break**.

## 🧪 curl Tips

- Basic request:  
    `curl https://facebook.com`
    
- Verbose output (`-v`) shows:
    
    - HTTPS/TLS negotiation
        
    - Request/response headers
        
    - Line break between headers and body
        
- Redirection:
    
    - HTTP → HTTPS shows `301 Moved Permanently` with `Location` header.
        
    - Use `-L` to follow redirects:  
        `curl -L http://facebook.com`
        
- Change request method:  
    `curl -X POST https://example.com`  
    → If `405`, method is not allowed on that URL.
    
- Add headers manually:  
    `curl -H "User-Agent: ChatGPT" https://example.com`

## ⚠️ Security Note

- **User-Agent spoofing** is a common technique in attacks.
    
- Never rely only on headers for security logic.
