## 1. Login to Ubuntu Server via SSH

Open a terminal and split the screen.

- In the **left terminal**, connect to the Ubuntu server via SSH:

```bash
ssh your_user@ubuntu-server
```

(Ensure `ubuntu-server` is set in `/etc/hosts`.)

## 2. Download and Run Nginx in Docker

- Pull the Nginx image:

```bash
docker image pull nginx
```

- List installed images:

```bash
docker image ls
```

- Run Nginx in a container:

```bash
docker container run --rm -p 80:80 nginx
```

- `--rm`: Removes the container after stopping.
- `-p 80:80`: Maps port 80 of the container to port 80 on the host.

## 3. Test Nginx from Kali

- In the **right terminal** (Kali):

```bash
curl http://ubuntu-server
```

If successful, you will see Nginx’s default welcome page.

- In the **Ubuntu terminal**, you’ll see a log entry like:

```bash
192.168.1.12 - - [12/Mar/2025:21:11:23 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 615 "-" "curl/8.12.1" "-"
```

## 4. Test a Non-Existent Endpoint

- From Kali, test an invalid endpoint:

```bash
curl http://ubuntu-server/test
```

- Expected response:

```bash
404 Not Found
```

- Ubuntu logs will record the failed request.

## 5. Test with Netcat

- From Kali, send an HTTP request using netcat:

```bash
echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: ubuntu-server\r\n\r\n" | nc ubuntu-server 80
```

- Expected output: The raw HTML of the Nginx welcome page.

## 6. Test with a Browser

- Open `http://ubuntu-server` in a browser.
- The Nginx page loads and Ubuntu logs a new request with a new **User-Agent** string for the browser, and note that this **User-Agent** can be spoofed.
- The browser also requests `favicon.ico`, causing a `404 Not Found`. This small icon is typically displayed in the browser's tab, bookmarks, and address bar to represent the website visually.
- Refreshing the page results in a **304 Not Modified** response, meaning cached content is used.

## 7. Stop and Clean Up Docker

- Stop the running container:

```bash
Ctrl + C
```

- Check for running containers:

```bash
docker container ls
```

- If the container was not removed (i.e., `--rm` was not used), remove it manually:

```bash
docker container rm ID_OR_NAME
```

- To clean all stopped containers:

```bash
docker container prune
```

## 8. Key Points About Removing Containers

- **Containers are temporary instances** of Docker images that run processes.
- **Stopping a container** only pauses it, but does not delete it.
- **Removing a container** permanently deletes it, freeing up system resources.
- When a container is removed:
    - It no longer appears in `docker container ls -a`.
    - Any data stored inside is **lost** unless a volume is used.
    - A new container can always be started from the same image.
