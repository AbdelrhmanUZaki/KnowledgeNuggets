# Writing Tips

#### Audience Awareness

- Write **technical content for technical readers**.
    
- If developers are present, **address them directly**.
    
- If not, tailor advice to what the **client can reasonably do**.
    
#### Tone & Framing

- Be **helpful, not judgmental**—even with simple mistakes.

- Frame small or easy-to-fix issues as **“quick wins”** rather than careless errors.
	
- **Never sound condescending**.
    
- Kindness builds trust.
    
#### Writing Style

- Cover all steps clearly.
    
- Use **active voice** and avoid “we/I”.
    
- Refer to **assessors** or **$Firm_Name**, not yourself.
    
#### Citing & Explaining

- Don’t assume readers know vulnerabilities—**explain them**.
    
- Link to **OWASP**, **MDN**, CVE, or CWE entries with context.
    
#### Disclosure

- For new vulns, follow the org’s **VDP** or agree on one.
- **Respect NDAs and intellectual property rights** when disclosing or publishing.
    
#### Report Length

> A good report is like pants:  
> Long enough to cover everything, short enough not to trip over.
