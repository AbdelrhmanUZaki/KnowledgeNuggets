# Report Structure

#### Risk/Severity Scale

- **Define all severity terms** used in the report clearly.
    
- Ensure even non-technical stakeholders (e.g., leadership) understand what terms like _"Critical"_ mean.
    
- Discuss vulnerabilities in terms of **real-world impact**.
    
- **Link severities to remediation timelines** (immediate attention, within 30 days, ...etc)

#### Executive Summary

- **Placement**: This is the first section in the report.
    
- **Purpose**: Deliver a broad, high-level overview of security findings.
    
- **Contents**:
    
    - Breakdown of findings **by severity**
        
    - Identification of **what must be prioritized**
        
    - Estimations of **what is needed to remediate**
        
    - Suggested **remediation timeline** for each severity level
        
---
#### Technical Report

- A **detailed breakdown** of each test and result.
    
- Include **proof of exploitation** (screenshots, logs, PoC code, etc.).
    
- Add **developer guidance** for fixing the issues found.
    
- Include **system hardening tips** for system administrators.
    
- Above all, **back up every claim with evidence**:
    
    - Screenshots
    - Logs
    - Network captures
    - Tool output
        
---
#### Appendices

- Include supporting **tool outputs** such as:
    
    - ZAP reports
    - Feroxbuster or Dirbuster logs
    - SQLMap findings
    
- Important notes:
    - Be **very cautious** about including secrets or credentials.
    - Demonstrate exploitation steps, but **do not include cleartext credentials**.
        
- **Appendix = raw data**, not analysis.

#### ZAP Report Guidelines

- **Before export**:
    
    - Remove any sites from the scan results that are **outside the scope** of your test.
        
    - This prevents unrelated alerts from polluting the findings.
        
    - **Add manual findings** as custom alerts in ZAP.
        
    - Loop through all alerts to **remove false positives**.
        
- **Quality of alerts**:
    
    - Some alerts like _missing anti-clickjacking header on WebSocket channels_ are **not useful**—remove them.
        
    - Similarly, **CSP alerts on API endpoints** can be ignored—CSP is only relevant when the content is rendered in a browser.
        
- **Output**:
    
    - Use **Modern HTML Report** with full sections (alerts, stats, parameters, etc.).
    - Output is in `.html` with support files (JS, CSS) = delivery as a **.zip** package.
