# Scoping

### Key Questions

- What is being tested?
    
- What are the expected outcomes?
    
- How much backend access is allowed?
    
---
#### Backend Access Levels

- **Door Open**: Full access (e.g., source code, configs)
    
- **Door Ajar**: Partial access (some code/configs)
    
- **Door Closed**: No privileged information
    
---
### Timing

- Define **when** testing is allowed.
    
- Never test **outside the agreed windows**.
    

---

### Safety Considerations

- Confirm backups.
    
- Clarify if testing is on production.
    
---
### Infrastructure Setup

- Are firewalls in place? Are we testing **through them**?
    
- Role-based access: Are we testing as **Admin**, **User**, or with **no auth**?
    

---

### Risky or Noisy Activities

- Is **fuzzing** allowed?
    
- Any **potentially destructive tests**?
    
- Always have **waivers** signed for risky actions.
    
---
### Post-Exploitation

- If code execution is achieved, **is privilege escalation or lateral movement in scope**?
