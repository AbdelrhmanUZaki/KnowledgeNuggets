# Frontend Considerations

### JS Frameworks in Modern Apps

- Frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue are widely used.
    
- Theyâ€™re battle-tested and secure by default, but not immune to bugs.
    
- Look for vulnerabilities in the **custom code**, not the framework itself.
    

### Framework Highlights

**Angular**

- Built by Google, uses TypeScript.
    
- v1 (AngularJS): easier to attack.
    
- v2+: more structured, typed, harder to break.
    

**React**

- Built by Facebook.
    
- Uses JSX (HTML+JS in one file), may look odd when reviewing code.
    

**Vue**

- Community-driven (not from FAANG).
    
- Uses template-based HTML with embedded JS in `.vue` files.

## Minification and Transpiling

### Minified JS

- Removes whitespace, shortens variables.
    
- Hard to read, but still useful with pretty-print.
    

### Transpiled JS

- Written in languages like TypeScript and compiled to JS.
    
- Often multiple files bundled into one.
    
- Minification is common, but not always included.

## Reviewing Code for Vulnerabilities

- Use browser **DevTools** to inspect frontend logic.
    
- Look for **source maps** (if available) to view original source.
    
- Familiarity with frameworks helps in analyzing multiple apps efficiently.

## APIs and Attack Surface

- Apps still communicate with the backend via APIs.
    
- API traffic (JSON, etc.) is a prime place for bugs and injection points.
    
- Inspect all HTTP requests and responses.
    
- Vulnerabilities often start where **user input** meets the backend.
