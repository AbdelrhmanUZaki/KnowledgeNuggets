- Client-side logic runs in the browser.
    
- Never assume client code is hidden—it's exposed.
    
- Attack strategy depends on where the code runs.
    
- Even server-side apps often include visible client-side logic.

- Tools like ZAP may miss dynamic content.
    
- Manual analysis is often required.
