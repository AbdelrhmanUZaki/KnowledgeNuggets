## Setup

```bash
# SSH into ubuntu-server
cd ~/pwst-resources/3-5_lab-dvwa
docker compose up -d
```

- Access DVWA at: `http://ubuntu-server:8001`
    

---

## ZAP Scanning Notes

- Run **Spider** on `http://ubuntu-server:8001`
    
- ZAP captures the **login POST request**  
    → Contains a **CSRF token**
    

---

## CSRF Token Handling

- The CSRF token appears:
    
    - In the **HTML page source**
        
    - In the **login request** sent via ZAP
        

### Why is CSRF important?

- Tokens are used to prevent forged login attempts.
    
- ZAP:
    
    - Detects standard token names (e.g., `csrf`, `token`)
        
    - ZAP with its Anti-CSRF super power could automatically regenerates fresh tokens for active scans
        
- You can register custom token names under:
    
    - **Options > Anti CSRF**
	    - Set a new one named `user_token`, this is the one that DVWA used in the login page.

## Brute Force Simulation via Fuzzing

1. In ZAP, open the captured login POST request.
    
2. Set `username=admin`
    
3. Highlight the **password** field value.
    
4. Right-click → **Fuzz**
    
5. Add this list as payloads:
    
    ```
    letmein
    password
    Password
    admin
    superman
    ```
    

---

## Fuzzer Settings

- Go to **Options > Follow Redirects** → Enable
    
- Set **Concurrency = 1**
    
    - CSRF tokens are **one-time use**
        
    - Multiple parallel requests cause CSRF token mismatch errors
        

---

## Message Processors

- In **Message Processors > Add > Tag Creator**:
    
    - Match: `Login failed`
        
    - Tag: `Login failed`
        
- Ensure that **Anti CSRF Tokens** is listed in **Message Processors** page.

## Result Analysis

- Review the **State** and **Content Length** columns in the fuzzer results
    
- The attempt with:
    
    ```
    password=password
    ```
    
    - Has **no tag**
        
    - Has a **larger response body** with new content like `Welcome :: Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) v1.10 *Development*`
        
    - Indicates a **successful login**
    - You could login from the browser with admin/password to make sure.

⚠️ **Keep DVWA running** — it’s needed for many lessons.
