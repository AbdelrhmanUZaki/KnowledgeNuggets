# Discoveries

This section builds on what was found during the automated and manual enumeration.

#### `/ftp`

From `feroxbuster`, we found the following exposed path:

```
http://ubuntu-server:8002/ftp
```

This is a **directory listing finding** — always a red flag. If you see an open directory, explore every file and subdirectory inside.

Contents of `/ftp`:

- `/ftp/acquisitions.md`: This file leaks sensitive internal business info.

	```
	# Planned Acquisitions
	
	This document is confidential! Do not distribute!
	Our company plans to acquire several competitors within the next year...
	```

This is an information leakage finding.

#### `/ftp/package.json.bak` – Version Disclosure & Vulnerability Mapping

The file `package.json` often lists JavaScript dependencies and their versions. These can be looked up in vulnerability databases like `Snyk`, `npm audit`, or `CVE databases` like https://exploit-db.com to identify known issues in those specific package versions.

If we can access it (even in backup or old form), we could fingerprint the entire tech stack and identify component-level vulnerabilities.

##### Bypassing File Extension Filters (403 Error)

Tried accessing:

```
http://ubuntu-server:8002/ftp/package.json
```

Got this error:

> 403 Error: Only .md and .pdf files are allowed!

This is a file upload or access filter based on extensions.

##### Attempt 1: Null byte injection

A null byte (`\x00`) is a special character that signifies the end of a string in many programming languages. Attackers use it to confuse input validation logic, where the system checks only the part before the null byte but processes the whole file name.

Tried:

```
package.json.bak%00.md
```

But it resulted in a `400 Bad Request`.

##### Attempt 2: URL-encoded null byte

Encoded `%` as `%25` to avoid early decoding:

```
package.json.bak%2500.md
```

This **bypassed** the restriction. Likely because:

- The server only checked if the path ends in `.md`.
    
- The actual file access logic read only up to the null byte, interpreting it as `package.json.bak`.
    
This is improper input validation finding — a common and dangerous vulnerability.

#### `/profile`

Shows:

> Blocked illegal activity by (IPv6)

You can trace the behavior and logic from the GitHub repo.

#### `/metrics`

This showed up after letting `feroxbuster` run longer.

- Provides internal backend statistics.

- Definitely not intended for public access.
    
- This is an Application Misconfiguration finding.

#### `/restricted` 

Returns a `500 Internal Server Error`.

- Tried injecting things into the URL (like testing for XSS) as we saw the `/restriced` is reflected int the website.
    
- However: The reflected value is wrapped in `""` (quotes) — so XSS may not trigger.
    
- Still worth testing; sometimes it's easy to overlook exploitable contexts.
    
Always inspect the source/DOM and test even low-confidence inputs — surprises happen.
