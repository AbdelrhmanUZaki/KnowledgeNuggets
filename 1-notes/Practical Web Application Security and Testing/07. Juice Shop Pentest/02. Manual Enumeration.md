# Manual Enumeration

During manual enumeration, we focus on reviewing what an attacker might find just by browsing the application without using automated tools.

#### Checking Well-Known Files
Two files that are often exposed and can provide useful information are:

- `robots.txt`
	Attackers often use this to find **hidden but accessible** areas.
	```
	User-agent: * Disallow: /ftp
	```
	- The `/ftp` directory is disallowed for indexing—this is a clear hint that it might contain sensitive or interesting content worth investigating manually.
    
- `security.txt`
	A standard file (similar to `robots.txt`) used to disclose the security contact and policy info for ethical hackers. It can provide insight into intended disclosure workflows or related endpoints.

Hiring: /#/jobs Csaf: http://localhost:3000/.well-known/csaf/provider-metadata.json Expires: Mon, 04 May 2026 15:35:29 GMT
	```
	
	Interesting links like `/#/score-board` and `/#/jobs` are Angular routes that may expose app functionality or features.

#### Manual Exploration in the Browser

Since Juice Shop is a modern Angular application (using hash-based client-side routing like `/#/route`), automated scanners like ZAP and Feroxbuster won't uncover all the frontend routes effectively.

> **Important:** Open the browser's developer tools (F12) and use the **Console** and **Network** tabs:

- **Console tab** can show JavaScript errors, warnings, or dynamic code execution.
- **Network tab** reveals API requests/responses, hidden AJAX calls, and file loads.

#### Observations from UI and Source Code

- From the navigation menu, the GitHub icon includes a `to` parameter. This could potentially lead to an **open redirect** vulnerability if mishandled.

Go to the browser's **Developer Tools → Sources** tab and open `main.js`. Then, search for `"photo-wall"` (a route that we discovered from the main navigation menu). This reveals other Angular client-side routes as well.

#### Extracting Angular Routes

Once the routes array is located inside `main.js`, copy and save the paths to a separate file. Here's a command to cleanly extract the path names:

```bash
grep "path:" paths.js | tr -s " " | cut -d " " -f 3
```

Some paths like `administration` are juicy.

```
└──╼ $grep "path:" paths.js | tr -s " " | cut -d " " -f 3
"administration",
"accounting",
"about",
"address/select",
"address/saved",
"address/create",
"address/edit/:addressId",
"delivery-method",
"deluxe-membership",
"saved-payment-methods",
"basket",
"order-completion/:id",
"contact",
"photo-wall",
"complain",
"chatbot",
"order-summary",
"order-history",
"payment/:entity",
"wallet",
"login",
"forgot-password",
"recycle",
"register",
"search",
"hacking-instructor",
"score-board",
"track-result",
"track-result/new",
"2fa/enter",
"privacy-security",
"privacy-policy",
"change-password",
"two-factor-authentication",
"data-export",
"last-login-ip",
"juicy-nft",
"wallet-web3",
"web3-sandbox",
"bee-haven",
"403",
"**",
```

#### Note

The `main.js` file is **minified**, making it hard to read. So instead of fully reversing it, we’ll explore its behavior by observing how the app behaves during normal usage and analyzing it in ZAP and browser developer tools contextually.
