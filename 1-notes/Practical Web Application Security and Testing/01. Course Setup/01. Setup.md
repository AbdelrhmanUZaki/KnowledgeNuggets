# Setup

## Hypervisors

A **hypervisor** is the software that allows us to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) and virtual networks. There are two types of hypervisors:

- **Type 1 (Bare Metal/Native Hypervisors)**: Installed directly on hardware.
    
- **Type 2 (Software-Defined Hypervisors)**: Runs on top of an existing OS.
### Our Options:

#### Hyper-V
- Type-1 Hypervisor
- Windows-only
- Fast but harder to manage
#### VirtualBox (I'll use this option)
- Free, Open Source
- Type-2 Hypervisor
- Cross-platform
## Lab Design

We will set up the following environment:
- **Two Virtual Machines:**
    - **Kali Linux** (for penetration testing) 
	    - Personally I prefer to use [Parrot Security](https://www.parrotsec.org/download/) HTB Edition BTW.
    - **Ubuntu Web Server** (for hosting services)
        
- **Networking Configuration:**
    - Direct Internet access
    - Internal network between VMs
## Backup Plans

Since no setup is perfect, here are alternative options:
- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**
    - Easy to get started    
    - Tricky to manage networking    
- **Cloud VMs**
    - Expensive but scalable  
- **Old Laptop**
    - Install Kali Linux directly on hardware

### OS Downloads
- [](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms)
- [Ubuntu Server Download](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)    

> Practical installation of Hyper-V, VirtualBox, Kali Linux, and Docker is covered in the course.

## Essential Tools Installation

### Install common utilities:

```
sudo apt install -y fish terminator gedit python3-pip vim-gtk3 alien
```
### Install Brave Browser:

```
curl -fsS https://dl.brave.com/install.sh | sh
```
### Install VS Code:

1. Download [VS Code](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=760868) .deb file.
2. Install it using:
```
sudo apt install ./<file>.deb
```
### Install Rust:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Press `1` or hit `Enter` to select the default option and proceed with the installation.

After installation:
- For **Bash**:
```
echo 'source $HOME/.cargo/env' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
- For **Zsh**:
```
echo 'source $HOME/.cargo/env' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
### Install Rust Security Tools:
```
cargo install rustscan feroxbuster
```

> **Feroxbuster** is a tool for brute-force directory and file discovery in web applications.

---
## Running Shell Scripts

To execute a shell script in the current directory:

```
./file_name.sh
```

To change the default shell:

```
chsh -s $(which fish) ## will make fish as the default shell
```

---

## Virtual Machine Networking

For communication between **Kali Linux** and **Ubuntu VMs**, configure the **VirtualBox** network settings:

- Set both VMs to **Bridged Mode** instead of NAT.
- This allows them to have IPs in the same network.

### Testing Network Connectivity

To verify connectivity, ping Ubuntu from Kali:

```
ping -c 4 ubuntu_ip_address
```

To connect via SSH from Kali to Ubuntu:

```
ssh ubuntu_username@ubuntu_ip
```

Type `yes` when prompted, then enter `ubuntu_username`'s password to access Ubuntu from Kali.

### Easier SSH Access with Hostnames

Instead of using the IP, you can assign a hostname for the Ubuntu VM:

1. Open the hosts file in **Vim**:

```
sudo vim /etc/hosts
```

1. Press `i` to enter insert mode.
2. Add an entry like:
```
192.168.X.X ubuntu-server
```

1. Press `ESC`, then type `:wq` to save and exit.

Now, you can use:
```
ping -c 4 ubuntu-server
ssh ubuntu_username@ubuntu-server
```

## Running Ubuntu VM in Headless Mode (VirtualBox)

To run Ubuntu without opening its window, use **Headless Mode** instead of the **Start** button.

## Installing Docker on Ubuntu

Follow the official guide [](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#installation-methods) or use these commands:

### Add Docker Repository

```
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

### Install Docker Engine

```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

> **WARNING:** The following command allows running Docker without `sudo`. Use it only in a learning environment:

```
sudo gpasswd -a ubuntu_username docker
```

This change will take effect after logging out and back in:

```
exit
ssh ubuntu_username@ubuntu_ip
```

### Verify Docker Installation

To list Docker images:

```
docker image ls
```

You should see an empty list since no images are downloaded yet.

To test Docker in one step:
```
docker container run hello-world
```

If Docker is working correctly, you will see `Hello from Docker!` in the output from the `hello-world` image.
