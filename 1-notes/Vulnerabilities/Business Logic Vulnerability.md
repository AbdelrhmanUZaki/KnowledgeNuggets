# Business Logic Vulnerability


Business logic vulnerabilities occur when an application’s legitimate processes are manipulated to cause unintended and harmful outcomes. Unlike typical security flaws (e.g., missing authentication or poor input validation), these issues stem from flaws in how the application handles real-world business rules.

They’re hard to detect automatically, often requiring a deep understanding of the business context to identify. Examples include processing orders without verification, granting access without proper authorization, or skipping manual review for high-value transactions.

These flaws aren’t the same as general technical vulnerabilities and are usually not covered by automated tools. They are often low in frequency but can have high impact due to their integration with critical business processes.

**Key Insight:** If understanding the vulnerability requires understanding the business, it's likely a business logic flaw.
