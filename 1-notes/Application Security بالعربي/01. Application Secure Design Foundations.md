# Application Secure Design Foundations


Focusing only on penetration testing is insufficient. It comes too late in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and fixing vulnerabilities at that point is often costly and time-consuming. AppSec addresses this by embedding security early in the process—preventing issues before they arise.

The table below highlights the key differences between Application Security and Penetration Testing across several critical factors.

| Factor       | Application Security (AppSec)                                                            | Penetration Testing (PT)                                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Definition   | A proactive discipline that integrates security into the software development lifecycle  | A simulated attack to identify exploitable vulnerabilities               |
| Timing       | Ongoing throughout development and maintenance                                           | Performed periodically (e.g., before release or quarterly)               |
| Approach     | Preventative                                                                             | Reactive                                                                 |
| Methods      | Secure coding, threat modeling, static/dynamic analysis (SAST/DAST), DevSecOps practices | Manual testing, vulnerability scanning, red teaming, exploit development |
| Performed by | AppSec Engineers, DevSecOps Engineers                                                    | Penetration Testers                                                      |

## DevSecOps Integration

**DevSecOps** shifts security left—bringing security into the DevOps pipeline from the first lines of code to production deployment. The goal is to prevent vulnerabilities early, reduce false positives, and respond to issues faster.

> Security often conflicts with time. When trying to check every injection point or access control flaw, there's rarely enough time to cover everything thoroughly.

### Key Practices

- **Shift Left**: Integrate security early in the pipeline.
- **Automate Checks**: CI/CD pipelines enforce secure practices.
- **Continuous Remediation**: Address findings promptly.
- **Pipeline Integration**: Security tools run automatically during pre-commit, build, and deployment.

## DevSecOps Example Workflow

### Stage 1: PRE-COMMIT

- Pre-commit Hooks → `Talisman` (detects secrets)
    
- Secrets Scanning → `TruffleHog`, `GitLeaks`
    
- Secure Coding Standards → OWASP Secure Coding Practices Guide
    
- Threat Modeling
    

### Stage 2: COMMIT

- Software Composition Analysis (SCA) → `OWASP Dependency-Check`, `Snyk`, `Whitesource`
    
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security → `Checkov`, `Terraform Sentinel`
    
- Container Security → `DockerScan`, `Anchore`, `Trivy`
    
- Static Analysis (SAST) → `SonarQube`, `Semgrep`, `Bandit` (Python)
    

### Stage 3: ACCEPTANCE (TESTING)

- DAST → `OWASP ZAP`, `Burp Suite`, `Netsparker`, `Acunetix`
    
- IAST → `Contrast Security`, `Seeker`  

> IAST combines SAST and DAST with runtime monitoring, giving accurate results with fewer false positives.
> It tracks which code gets executed when a certain URL is triggered but is **not CI-friendly** because it needs manual browsing and slows down performance, so it’s mainly used in testing environments.
    
### Stage 4: PRODUCTION

- Policy Enforcement → `Open Policy Agent (OPA)`, `Kubernetes RBAC`
    
- Cloud Security Compliance → `AWS Security Hub`, `Azure Security Center`, `GCP Security Command Center`
    
- Secrets Management → `Vault by HashiCorp`, `AWS Secrets Manager`, `Doppler`
    

> OPA provides policy enforcement as code—allowing version control and integration into CI/CD.

### Stage 5: OPERATIONS

- Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)
    
- SIEM → `Splunk`, `Elastic Security`, `Graylog`
    
- Threat Detection & Response → `Wazuh`, `Osquery`, `AWS GuardDuty`
    
- Logging & Alerting → `Prometheus + Grafana`, `ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash ,Kibana)`
    
- Threat Intelligence

## Threat Modeling

Threat modeling identifies your application’s components, how they interact, and what threats could compromise them. It enables you to assess third-party elements vs. what you build yourself.

> Think of it as “anticipating disaster before it strikes.”

### Common Frameworks

| Framework    | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| STRIDE       | Categorizes threats: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, DoS, Priv. Escalation  |
| DREAD        | Assigns risk scores based on Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability |
| PASTA        | A process-oriented framework focusing on business impact                                              |
| MITRE ATT&CK | Maps adversary tactics and techniques to real-world attack patterns                                   |
| Trike        | Risk-based model focused on audit and control                                                         |

### Threat Modeling Demo

Consider a simple web application with the following functions:

- **User Registration** – Users can create accounts
    
- **Reset Password** – Users can initiate password resets
    
- **User Authentication** – Users log in with their credentials
    
- **Profile Management** – Users can edit their profile data
    
- **API Endpoint `/api/data`** – Returns user-related information
    

Based on this functionality, we can identify and categorize potential threats using the STRIDE framework, **as illustrated in the following table**:

### STRIDE Example Threats & Mitigations

| Threat Category        | Example                         | Mitigation                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Spoofing               | Brute-force or MFA bypass       | Use `bcrypt` hashing and require MFA             |
| Tampering              | Session hijacking               | Use `HttpOnly`, `Secure cookies`, session expiry |
| Repudiation            | Denial of performed actions     | Implement audit logs with timestamps             |
| Information Disclosure | User enumeration via APIs       | Restrict and control API responses               |
| Denial of Service      | Brute-force account lockouts    | Implement rate limiting                          |
| Privilege Escalation   | Users accessing admin endpoints | Enforce RBAC and validate user roles             |

## Secure by Design Principles

Security is most effective when it’s embedded in system design—not added afterward. Ignoring this often results in vulnerabilities that are expensive to fix and damaging if exploited.

### 1. Least Privilege

- Run services with only the permissions they require so, If a process is compromised, this limits an attacker’s scope.
- **Example**: A non-root user should run services unless absolutely necessary.
### 2. Defense in Depth

- Multiple layers of defense protect against single-point failures.  
- **Example 1**: A compromised user account from another country triggers a geo-location alert in SIEM before deeper harm occurs.
- **Example 2**: Authentication → Captcha → WAF → GeoIP alerting via SIEM
### 3. Secure Defaults & Fail-Safe

- Applications should deny access by default.  
- **Example**: APIs should not return all users data if the user ID is missing. Systems should fail closed, not open.

### 4. Open Design

- Use well-tested, open cryptographic standards (e.g., AES, RSA), not proprietary methods.
### 5. Minimize Attack Surface

- Disable unused endpoints and admin panels.
    
- Remove debug code in production.
    
- Use IP whitelisting or jump hosts for sensitive access.

### 6. Secure Input Handling & Validation

- Never trust user input. Always validate on client and server.
- Use **prepared statements** instead of string concatenation for SQL.
    
```python
# Secure query with parameter binding
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_input,))
```

### 7. Secure Authentication & Authorization

- Use MFA and modern auth protocols like OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.  
- Delegating auth to trusted providers (e.g., Google login) reduces risk.
